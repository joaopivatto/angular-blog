Welcome to my **very first Angular project**! 🎉  
This is a simple blog application where I’m experimenting and learning the Angular framework. It’s just the beginning — expect many updates and new features soon!

## 🧠 About the Project

This blog is built with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and is designed to:

- 📰 Display a list of blog posts
- 📄 Show post details
- 🛠️ Be updated frequently as I learn new concepts
- 🎨 Serve as a playground to practice components, routing, services, and more
